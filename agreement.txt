Our agreement in a nutshell

-	We will work to the best of our abilities to deliver what we agree to do in this document, we expect you to respond promptly to requests to define requirements, review deliverables and provide all required access and resources when needed.
-	You can cancel the contract at any time for any reason and pay only for work you have accepted, but we expect you to share any feedback or concern as early as possible.
-	You can make as many modifications as you want on the deliverables or the way we execute the work, provided you request the change in written (an email is fine) and negotiate a fair adjustment on scope, cost or delivery dates.
-	We will make all reasonable efforts to provide error-free software, and for as long as we are in business and you use our software, we’ve got your back: should something “break”, we will help you to troubleshoot the problem, if we find the problem to be caused by a bug on the software we wrote, we will fix our software at no charge, but if the problem is caused by any other reason (e.g. a software upgrade not executed by us, a change on an API provided by you or a third-party, operator error, negligence, natural disaster, etc.), we will still help you to solve the problem or recommend a solution and charge you at our current hourly rate.
-	We are here to build a mutually beneficial relationship, we are also flexible and understand life, nature and business are un-predictable, talk to us if you want to negotiate a payment extension or postpone the work, but we reserve the right to cancel the contract if an invoice has not been paid in full for more than 30 calendar days from the date we send it to you electronically.
-	We will not disclose any information you share with us (unless required by law); we expect you to treat any information we share with you with the same level of confidentiality.
