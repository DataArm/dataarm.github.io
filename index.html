              <p>In a data center, office, or IoT environment it is frequently necessary to find a network-enabled device by its physical address.</p>
              <p>This process takes anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple of hours and requires a solid understanding of network technology, enough access rights to log into management devices, and of course, you have to remember the different syntax implemented by the various vendors you may have.</p>
              <p>We can bring this process down to 15 seconds for anybody in your team, even if it's their first day on the job and they have never taken any networking training.</p>
              <p>Does that sound valuable? We sure think it is!</p>
              <p>We've seen the need for this in different situations, like tracking down a printer in the middle of a manufacturing company with 250+ switches or responding to a security breach notice about a rogue device swapping MAC addresses from under an unused desk.</p>
              <p>The usual process goes like this:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>You start by contacting your network team, network contractor, or somebody with network training that has access to the admin interface on the routers, switches, access points and other network gear.</p></li>
                <li><p>Your network engineer will open a session to one of those devices, escalate to gain admin rights, and start hunting down through the output of console commands.</p></li>
                <li><p>If you are on a Juniper-based infrastructure, some of the commands he will have to use (and remember the syntax) are: show ethernet-switching table, show bridge mac-table, show arp, etc.</p></li>
                <li><p>If on Cisco, the commands are of course different: traceroute, show arp, show mac address-table address, etc.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This process will quickly get more complicated, frustrating and lengthy if you have several independently managed networks, different vendors (or even different versions from the same vendor that don't support the same commands).</p>
              <p>Tracking down a MAC address with InsightNow! is as simple as opening your web browser, typing it down and waiting a few seconds until we find any occurrence throughout your infrastructure.</p>
              <p>And we will find it, anywhere it is, including VMWare or other virtualization platforms (it may be the MAC address of a managed system), your documentation portal (maybe somebody already documented that they are using this particular MAC address for some specific purpose), you certainly can't do that from within your network managed devices!</p>
