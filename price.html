            <h2>Our standard license/contract</h2>
            <p>This is what you get, and the only "legal paperwork" you will see from us</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We will work to the best of our abilities to deliver what we agree to do in this document, you have the power and ability to enter into this contract on behalf of your organization and to respond promptly to our requests to define requirements, review deliverables and provide all required access and resources when needed.</li>
              <li>You can cancel the contract at any time for any reason and pay only for the work you have accepted, but we expect you to share any feedback or concern as early as possible so we can offer an alternative if within our remit.</li>
              <li>You can make as many modifications as you want on the deliverables or the way we execute the work, provided you request the change in written (an email is fine) and negotiate a fair adjustment on scope, cost or delivery date.</li>
              <li>We will not disclose any information you share with us; we expect you to treat any information we share with you with the same level of confidentiality, including our software and any related material, we don’t expect you to take any action with the intent to create or extend a competing or similar product (or allow, induce or aid any third party to do so).</li>
              <li>We will make all reasonable efforts to provide error-free software, but by the nature of software we can't guarantee it will always be the case, so we can’t be liable for damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate our software, but, we’ve got your back: should something break, we will help you to troubleshoot the problem at your request; if we find the problem to be caused by a bug on the software we delivered to you, we will fix the bug, and assist you during the event at no charge; but if the problem is caused by any other reason (e.g. a software upgrade not executed by us, a change on an API provided by you or a third-party, operator error, negligence, tampering, an act of God, force majeure, etc.), we will still help you to find a solution, if you so desire, and charge you for the time we spend assisting you at our current hourly rate.</li>
              <li>Talk to us if you want to extend, improve or integrate our software with another system of yours, we will help you to analyze the requirements and suggest ways to achieve the results you look for while ensuring you don’t unintentionally void our no-charge bug fix guarantee above.</li>
              <li>You can install, reinstall, scale up or down, migrate to more powerful hardware or choose any other method of deployment within your organization’s internal networks; there are no artificially-implemented usage restrictions in our software (other than the license been non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-resalable and for your employee’s internal-use only).</li>
              <li>We are here to build a mutually beneficial relationship, we are also flexible and understand life, nature and business are un-predictable, talk to us if you want to negotiate a payment extension or postpone the work, but we reserve the right to cancel the contract if an invoice has not been paid in full for more than 30 calendar days from the date we send it to you electronically or if you fail to meet your part of this agreement, we will however clearly communicate our intentions via email and offer flexible arrangements when possible, once again, please talk to us, we appreciate your business very much.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Pretty cool, eh?</h2>
            <p>In short, we expect you to play nice, and we impose no annoying limitations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Install one or multiple copies (as long as it is for your organization's internal use)</li>
              <li>Give access to one sysadmin or your whole IT crowd around the world, we are not counting "seats"</li>
              <li>All functionality is un-locked, no "premium" features, or "enterprise" versions</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>OK, the money</h2>
            <p>Also very simple, two options</p>
            <ul>
              <li>$275/month: Includes initial setup, but support (other than break-fix and our online documentation) is paid at our current hourly rate</li>
              <li>Tailored pricing (talk to us), available options include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Priority support (by an engineer), including retainers and fixed-price package</li>
                  <li>Integrations done by us (e.g. use as Ansible's "dynamic inventory" or Puppet's "external node classifier", integrate with your Cybersecurity tools to automatically route vulnerabilities to engineer and business owners, automatically populate your inventory systems, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Write new plugins</li>
                  <li>Create custom visualizations</li>
                  <li>We wrote the software, and support it, we can make any cool, integration happen</li>
                  <li>General consultation, DevOps automation pipelines, etc.</li>
                </ul>
